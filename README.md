## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
<img align="right" width="320" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjay-kv/sanjay-kv/main/Assets/illustration.png" />

🎓 MSc Advanced Computer Science (Data Analytics) student — University of Leeds  
📊 Background in computer science with a strong focus on data-driven problem solving  
🧠 Interested in analytics, machine learning, optimisation & predictive modelling  
🌱 Continuously building technical depth alongside leadership and communication skills  

My academic and professional journey is centred on using **data and technology to solve real problems**. I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from understanding the problem context and data quality, to analysis, modelling, and clearly communicating insights to technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🔍 Current Learning & Focus
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large, real-world datasets  
- Supervised machine learning and model evaluation  
- Feature engineering, metrics, and interpretability  
- Statistical reasoning for reliable decision-making
